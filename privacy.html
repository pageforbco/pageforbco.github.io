<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>1. Data Protection</h2>
<p>We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the processing of personal data ("data processing") by us when you use our app. It explains the type, purpose, and scope of data processing in the context of using the app.</p>

<h2>2. Controller</h2>
<p>"Controller" means the legal entity which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.</p>

Breviton UG (haftungsbeschränkt)<br>
Bessemerstraße 82<br>
12103 Berlin<br>
Mail: support@breviton.com<br>

<h2>3. General Information on Data Processing</h2>
<p>In the following, we would like to inform you about the general principles of data processing.</p>

<h3>a. Scope of Data Processing</h3>
<p>We only process your personal data insofar as this is necessary for the provision and use of our app with its content and services.</p>

<h3>b. Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
<p>Insofar as we obtain your consent for data processing, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for data processing.</p>
<p>Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis for data processing that is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract to which you are a party. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.</p>
<p>Insofar as data processing is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>
<p>If the data processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and your interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms do not outweigh the former interest, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.</p>

<h3>c. Storage Period and Deletion of Personal Data</h3>
<p>Your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies. Data may also be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws, or other provisions to which we are subject. Personal data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the personal data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p>

<h2>4. Specific Data Processing</h2>
<p>The following data processing takes place during our app:</p>

<h3>a. Download the App</h3>
<p>Our service is provided via the Google and Apple platforms. The platforms also offer the option of in-app purchases and other services of their own. We have no influence on their data processing and the respective platform operator is responsible for data protection. Their respective terms of use and privacy policy apply.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can find the Google Play Store's privacy policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de">here</a>.</li>
    <li>You can find the Apple App Store's privacy policy <a href="https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT211970">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>b. Account Creation</h3>
<p>The use of our service requires the creation of an account. This enables us to provide individualized services to the respective user and allows the user to access the service on different end devices.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Password</li>
    <li>Internal ID (unique user ID that is generated when the account is created)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data processing is carried out based on the user agreement and thus in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.</p>

<h3>c. Creation of Aggregated Information</h3>
<p>We may create aggregated statistical information from the personal data available to us. We may use this statistical information for various purposes, such as service optimization, improving our marketing campaigns, and similar purposes. The aggregated information is no longer personal data.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device type</li>
    <li>Operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Version of the operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Language setting of the end device</li>
    <li>Audio setting of the end device</li>

</ul>
<p>The creation of aggregated statistical information is based on our legitimate interest in enabling versatile analyses and evaluation of our app, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Your interests do not outweigh this either, as the aggregation of the data removes the personal reference and thus enables data-saving further processing.</p>
<p>The aggregated information is created by the service providers assigned to the app in section 4.b.</p>

<h3>d. Elimination of Individual Errors</h3>
<p>In some cases, it is not sufficient to process only aggregated information to rectify service errors that occur with an individual user; it is also necessary to view and evaluate personal data.</p>

    <li>Operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Version of the operating system of the end device</li>

<p>The processing of personal data for troubleshooting purposes is carried out by the service providers assigned to the app in section 4.b.</p>

<h3>e. Fraud Detection</h3>

<p>The following personal data may be processed for this purpose:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device type</li>

</ul>
<p>The processing of personal data is based on our legitimate interest, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. We have an interest in detecting misuse of our app. One of the reasons for this is that misuse could also constitute violations of legal norms.</p>
<p>Processing for the purpose of fraud detection is carried out by the service providers assigned to the app in section 4. b.</p>

<h3>f. Data Processors</h3>
<h4>aa. General Information</h4>
<p>This app relies on various data processors. Transparency is very important to us. This is why we do not only list primary, but also secondary data processors in this declaration that are often overlooked by data subjects as secondary processors are only accessible through intermediary websites, like e.g. the sub-processors of Google Admob, a service by Google LLC at 1600 Amphi-theatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google AdMob,” privacy policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>).</p>
<p>To give the data subject a better overview of the data processor landscape of this app, we provide a comprehensive list of data processors in this declaration, providing the name of the data processor as well as the privacy policy link and a brief business description. Through this, we hope to help the data subject make better decisions, e.g. when it comes to opting in to ad technology providers of their choice. Even though we try our best to keep this list up to date, for information regarding secondary data processors the information provided on the website of the primary data processors remains authoritative.</p>

<h4>bb. Detailed Information on Data Processors</h4>
<p>Below you find a list of Data Processors this app relies on. In line with our outlined ambitions, you will also find secondary data processors listed here. If you would like to know if a data processor is a secondary data processor, please check with the primary data processor of your interest.</p>
<p>The use of our app requires data processing without which the app cannot be operated. This data processing is required in particular to make the app available and playable in the first place, to recognise and correct errors, to retrieve scores or to link in-app purchases to the user account.</p>
<p>The following categories of personal data may be processed for this purpose:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Account name</li>
    <li>Internal ID we give to the user</li>
    <li>Number and content of in-app purchases</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal data is processed on the basis of the user agreement that you accepted when you created your account for the app and thus in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.</p>
<p>The personal data will be deleted as soon as there is no longer a reason for processing. This is typically the case when the contractual relationship ends, unless legal regulations require longer storage.</p>
