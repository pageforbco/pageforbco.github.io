<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>1. Data Protection</h2>
<p>We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the processing of personal data ("data processing") by us when you use our online games ("games"). It explains the type, purpose, and scope of data processing in the context of using the games.</p>

<h2>2. Controller</h2>
<p>"Controller" means the legal entity which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.</p>

<h2>3. General Information on Data Processing</h2>
<p>In the following, we would like to inform you about the general principles of data processing.</p>

<h3>a. Scope of Data Processing</h3>
<p>We only process your personal data insofar as this is necessary for the provision and use of our games with their content and services.</p>

<h3>b. Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
<p>Insofar as we obtain your consent for data processing, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for data processing.</p>
<p>Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis for data processing that is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract to which you are a party. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.</p>
<p>Insofar as data processing is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>
<p>If the data processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and your interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms do not outweigh the former interest, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.</p>

<h3>c. Storage Period and Deletion of Personal Data</h3>
<p>Your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies. Data may also be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws, or other provisions to which we are subject. Personal data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the personal data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p>

<h2>4. Specific Data Processing</h2>
<p>The following data processing takes place during our games:</p>

<h3>a. Download the App</h3>
<p>Our service is provided via the Google and Apple platforms. The platforms also offer the option of in-app purchases and other services of their own. We have no influence on their data processing and the respective platform operator is responsible for data protection. Their respective terms of use and privacy policy apply.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can find the Google Play Store's privacy policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de">here</a>.</li>
    <li>You can find the Apple App Store's privacy policy <a href="https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT211970">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>b. Account Creation</h3>
<p>The use of our service requires the creation of an account. This enables us to provide individualized services to the respective user and allows the user to access the service on different end devices.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Password</li>
    <li>Internal ID (unique user ID that is generated when the account is created)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data processing is carried out based on the user agreement and thus in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.</p>

<h3>c. Creation of Aggregated Information</h3>
<p>We may create aggregated statistical information from the personal data available to us. We may use this statistical information for various purposes, such as service optimization, improving our marketing campaigns, and similar purposes. The aggregated information is no longer personal data.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device type</li>
    <li>Operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Version of the operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Language setting of the end device</li>
    <li>Audio setting of the end device</li>
    <li>Graphics settings of the end device</li>
    <li>Installation source of the game</li>
    <li>IP address of the end device</li>
    <li>Marketing-specific attribution information (if the user has installed the app after viewing an advert)</li>
    <li>Google Advertising ID</li>
    <li>Apple IDFA (ID from Apple for advertisers)</li>
    <li>IDFV (ID from Apple for providers)</li>
    <li>Paying user status</li>
    <li>Days since download</li>
    <li>Setting for push notifications</li>
    <li>Country in which the game was downloaded</li>
    <li>Date of the download</li>
    <li>Version of the app that was downloaded</li>
    <li>Amount of real money spent</li>

    <li>Country in which the user uses the app</li>
    <li>Current app version</li>
    <li>Date of purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>The creation of aggregated statistical information is based on our legitimate interest in enabling versatile analyses and evaluation of our games, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Your interests do not outweigh this either, as the aggregation of the data removes the personal reference and thus enables data-saving further processing.</p>
<p>The aggregated information is created by the service providers assigned to the respective games in section 4.b.</p>

<h3>d. Elimination of Individual Errors</h3>
<p>In some cases, it is not sufficient to process only aggregated information to rectify game errors that occur with an individual user; it is also necessary to view and evaluate personal data.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device type</li>
    <li>Operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Version of the operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Language setting of the end device</li>
    <li>Audio setting of the end device</li>

    <li>IDFV (ID from Apple for providers)</li>
    <li>Paying user status</li>
    <li>Days since download</li>

    <li>Amount of real money spent</li>
    <li>Usage time</li>
    <li>Number of purchases</li>
    <li>Country in which the user uses the app</li>
    <li>Current app version</li>
    <li>Date of purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>Data processing is carried out on the basis of the user agreement that you accepted when you first opened the game and thus in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data for troubleshooting purposes is carried out by the service providers assigned to the respective games in section 4.b.</p>

<h3>e. Fraud Detection</h3>
<p>We may screen and validate personal data in order to identify any misuse of our games.</p>
<p>The following personal data may be processed for this purpose:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device type</li>
    <li>Operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Version of the operating system of the end device</li>
    <li>Language setting of the end device</li>

    <li>Date of the download</li>
    <li>Version of the app that was downloaded</li>
    <li>Amount of real money spent</li>
    <li>Playing time</li>
    <li>Number of purchases</li>
    <li>Country in which the user uses the app</li>
    <li>Current app version</li>
</ul>
<p>The processing of personal data is based on our legitimate interest, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. We have an interest in detecting misuse of our games. One of the reasons for this is that misuse could also constitute violations of legal norms.</p>
<p>Processing for the purpose of fraud detection is carried out by the service providers assigned to the respective games in section 4. b.</p>

<h3>f. Data Processors</h3>
<h4>aa. General Information</h4>
<p>This app relies on various data processors. Transparency is very important to us. This is why we do not only list primary, but also secondary data processors in this declaration that are often overlooked by data subjects as secondary processors are only accessible through intermediary websites, like e.g. the sub-processors of Google Admob, a service by Google LLC at 1600 Amphi-theatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google AdMob,” privacy policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>).</p>
<p>To give the data subject a better overview of the data processor landscape of this app, we provide a comprehensive list of data processors in this declaration, providing the name of the data processor as well as the privacy policy link and a brief business description. Through this, we hope to help the data subject make better decisions, e.g. when it comes to opting in to ad technology providers of their choice. Even though we try our best to keep this list up to date, for information regarding secondary data processors the information provided on the website of the primary data processors remains authoritative.</p>

<h4>bb. Detailed Information on Data Processors</h4>
<p>Google AdMob (a service by Google LLC at 1600 Amphi-theatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google AdMob,” privacy policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>) relies on a large number of data processors itself that usually remain.</p>
<p>The use of our games requires data processing without which the game cannot be operated. This data processing is required in particular to make the game available and playable in the first place, to recognise and correct errors, to retrieve scores or to link in-app purchases to the player account.</p>
<p>The following categories of personal data may be processed for this purpose:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Account name</li>

    <li>Number and content of in-app purchases</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal data is processed on the basis of the user agreement that you accepted when you created your account for the game and thus in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.</p>
<p>The personal data will be deleted as soon as there is no longer a reason for processing. This is typically the case when the contractual relationship ends, unless legal regulations require longer storage.</p>

<p>The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. Should we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove the corresponding link immediately.</p>
<p>These external links are for entertainment purposes only and a visit to the relevant websites or services is not mandatory in order to play the game.</p>

<h3>5. Data Processing in Third Countries</h3>
<p>We sometimes use processors to provide our content and services. For technical reasons, some of these processors have servers in third countries to which connections are established in special situations. In some cases, your personal data is also processed.</p>
<p>Insofar as data is processed outside the EU/EEA and there is no level of data protection corresponding to the European standard, which has been confirmed by the EU Commission by means of an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR, EU standard contractual clauses are concluded with the companies concerned in third countries in order to establish appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Art. 46 GDPR. A copy of the EU standard contractual clauses can be found here: <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=DE">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=DE</a>. It is noteworthy in this respect that some companies from the USA are certified in accordance with the EU/US Data Privacy Framework.</p>
<p>We have concluded EU standard contractual clauses with the following processors or those processors have concluded EU standard contractual clauses with their sub-processors processing in third countries or the data is processed on the basis of an adequacy decision or on the basis of an EU/US Data Privacy Framework certification:</p>
